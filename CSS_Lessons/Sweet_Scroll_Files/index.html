    <h3>Phesent Alfredo</h3>
    <p>This recipe is a great weeknight meal. 
      Creamy pasta alfredo with pheasant comes
      together in just 30 minutes and only uses
      one pot.

      The rich, Parmesan cream sauce is balanced by 
      light pheasant breast meat, and you can use any 
      pasta you want—linguine, fettuccine, or even 
      penne. Just make sure that the pasta is 
      completely submerged in step 2 to ensure even 
      cooking. 
    </p>
    <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
    <p>Set oven to warm. Pat pheasant breasts dry with a paper towels and season to taste with Montreal Chicken Seasoning. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and a splash of oil over medium-high heat. Brown meat on both sides and then transfer to an oven-proof bowl. Cover with foil and keep warm in the oven.</p>

    <p>In the same skillet, lower heat to medium and add more oil/butter if needed. Add minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Then add wine and thyme and simmer for 1 minute. Next, add chicken broth and heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Add pasta and stir until the strands are completely submerged. Simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until pasta is al dente, stirring frequently.</p>
      
      Discard thyme, add grated Parmesan, and stir well. Season with salt, pepper, and garnish with parsley. Slice pheasant breasts and serve with pasta while it’s hot.</p>
